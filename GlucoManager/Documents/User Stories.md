    1. Linda is a 55 year old high school teacher struggling with control of her type 1 diabetes.
    Her sensor does not provide her with enough information to edit her basal. She needs more insight into her levels.

    2. Bob is a 40 year old PE teacher with a HA1C of 6.0 but somehow he still feels symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
    Bob needs more information about the variability of his sugar levels to see if that could have any connection.

    3. Gayle is a doctor dealing with patients that claim to have put their diabetes into remission.    
    Their HA1C is under the diabetes level but she needs more insight into their levels to take any conclusions.

    4. Teddy is a father of a 10 year old with diabetes. He wants to keep record of his statistics to see if there is
    gradual improvement or not. Teddy needs to be supplied with more statistics than what the app provides.

    5. Mort is a nurse that works on a diabetes floor. She found a defect in the current diabetes review system.
    During the review the only metric checked is the HA1C which does not give enough information about the patients level
    of control. He needs access to more metrics that tell the rest of the story.
